# Penguin-Scratchin
An attempt to remake Scratchin Melodii's engine in [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com).

Inspired by TheShovel's [PenguinFunk](https://github.com/TheShovel/penguin-funk).


### So... why?
This isn't really anything special, just me seeing if this is even possible in the first place. This is also a great programming excersize, too!

### How does it work?
I'll update this section later, becuase this is so early in development. Sorry!
